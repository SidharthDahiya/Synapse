What is Weekday?
At Weekday, we are building the next frontier in hiring. We are transforming 
the way companies are recruiting with the help of superior sourcing 
technologies.
We are looking for Founder's Office interns to work closely with the CEO and 
COO on strategic projects.
Requirements
•
Very high ownership: Since you would be working the founders directly, 
don't expect to be managed or given exact tasks. Expect problems to 
be given to you and you would be expected to come up with solutions 
yourself
•
You should just "get things done"
•
Hard work: Expect long work hours
•
Either final year of college or minimal college workload -- you should 
have enough hours in the day free to work on problems given
•
Be the owner of your problem statement. When you start working on a 
problem, you would be expected to approach it as if it's your own little 
startup
•
You should have a high CGPA in your college (or any other proof-of-
work of hard work)
•
You are expected to be a barrel (as opposed to an ammunition) - refer 
Keith Rabois talk on the same 
 
Benefits
•
Your direct point of contact will be either CEO or COO, so you will have 
plenty of opportunities to learn about how a startup grows from the 
ground up and impact what processes are created to help the company 
scale
•
Even as an intern you would be owning initiatives end-to-end
•
We expect the ideal fit hire to move on to become integral part of our 
full-time team so ample chances to convert to a full-time role
